## Specs: Final

The Anthropic prior-art comparison is in orchestrate §2.1 and §10.2 and in the README.

**Open prior-art follow-ups:**
- Orchestrate bets that delegation cost (tokens, latency, lossy reports) is outweighed by cheaper actions. `resolve`,
  conditional intents and the re-read / planner-vs-executor token metrics (orchestrate §10.1) must show which cost
  dominates. Coding steps are interdependent (Anthropic: weaker fit for multi-agent).
- Branch's line-level trace (Anthropic PTC shows only logged/returned output) is a hypothesis to test.
- Anthropic's numbers are frontier-model results; results on deepseek-v4-flash are an open gap worth reporting.
- Consider rewriting branching-framework §1–2 to cite prior art and frame branch as the code-mode baseline/executor.

Spec review F1–F20 and the final check (2026-10-24) are complete; all feature specs are **Final**
(changes now need the user's approval). Notable final-check decisions: Claude Code plugin uses a
hooks module (prompt.compose / tool.call routing / tool.describe deferral) instead of agents +
settings.json; read-only mode denies non-read calls; task.md is the first user message; budget
per framework-runner §6.5 (CLAUDE.md updated); large dev problem deferred until `fulfil` exists.

**Next (in order):**
1. User's new orchestrate idea (adds one mode) — still to be presented.
2. Rebuild `framework/core/branch` per architecture/core-branch.md.

Commit spec/README changes as `docs:` commits when the user approves.

## Code state: `framework/core/branch/`

`branch.ts` (+ `framework/test/core-branch.test.ts`, uncommitted) is an early in-process runner from 2026-10-21. It
predates the architecture specs and does not match them (no isolate, instrumentation, recorder, `state` or renderers).
Rebuild it per architecture/core-branch.md rather than patching it; the old `src/runner.ts` path is replaced afterwards.
When the `packages/` layout (A-02) lands, update CLAUDE.md's `cd framework && npm test`.
Workflow: main session designs, Sonnet subagents execute, small steps.
